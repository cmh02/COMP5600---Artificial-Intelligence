# Artificial Intelligence - COMP5600

Welcome to my repository for the projects I made in my Artificial Intelligence class (COMP5600)! There are four large assignments that are completed here:

1) A basic python fundamentals project
2) A project that implements basic search algorithms such as BFS, DFS, and A* Search
3) A basic machine learning project that implements logistic regression model, naive bayes regression model, and k-means clustering model
4) A deep learning project that implements a RNN model, a LSTM model, and a CNN model

All of these assignments are completed "from scratch," meaning that they are built on their own and do NOT use pre-provided resources such as from PyTorch, TensorFlow, Keras, etc. Most implementations are built using only numpy and some basic uitilities provided from dataloaders and scikit-learn. Each project contains reports inside the respective Jupyter notebooks about the project background, my implementation, and results for the algorithms/models.
